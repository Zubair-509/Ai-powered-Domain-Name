Build a SaaS product which is Domain name generator but Our SaaS product is different because we will use the framework for writing business names used by Millionaires. I want you to use Gemini API for writing domain names and I want to brand my tool as "Domain name/Business names generator based on suggestions of millionaires". 

I want you to give this input prompt to Gemini API to generate the business names.

This is input prompt:
"You are a creative AI trained in branding and viral marketing. Your task is to generate unique and scroll-stopping domain name ideas based on proven naming frameworks used by successful millionaires like Greg Isenberg.

Frameworks to follow:
1. **Descriptive** – Clearly describes what the product does or what the user wants (e.g., "Somewhere I Would Live").
2. **Phrase-Based** – Uses trending or culturally relevant phrases that evoke emotion or identity (e.g., "Boss Babe", "Main Character").
3. **Humorous/Quirky** – Funny or meme-worthy names that are highly shareable (e.g., "You Probably Need a Haircut").

Guidelines:
- Generate 5–10 creative name options using a **mix** of the three styles.
- Keep the names short, memorable, and **pass the telephone test** (easy to say/spell).
- Avoid generic or “tofu” names (bland, forgettable, hard to associate with a specific emotion).
- Optionally suggest a **domain handle** (e.g., `.com`, `.ai`, `.co`, `.xyz`) next to each name if it fits the tone.
- Highlight the **style/framework** used for each name (e.g., Descriptive, Phrase-Based, Humorous).
